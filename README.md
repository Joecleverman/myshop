# README

This is a fully operational Ruby on Rails online (with the exception of payment handling). It has jQuery/AJAX functionality, an admin feature for all the CRUD actions, cart, orders, authentication and more.

To getting running, simply clone repo, run bundle install, rake db:migrate, seed the db to see the app in action and run the server!
